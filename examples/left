|c:|1528924222|+Mega Eevee X|At least it's a Dex entry
|c:|1528924231| Sean9447|That’s what really counts
|c:|1528924421| Sean9447|Ye
|c:|1528925012| TheJ3estPenguin|yes mex
|c:|1528925018| TheJ3estPenguin|they use them in arlington

|c:|1528925042|+Mega Eevee X|Yeah ok
|c:|1528925045|+Mega Eevee X|Ik
|c:|1528925737| Shotgun2010|these 2k eggs are really shit
|c:|1528925750| Shotgun2010|I was hoping for more larva but no
|c:|1528925766| Shotgun2010|just squirtle and totodile
|c:|1528925897| Shotgun2010|i’m on 360 larv candy and 200 rares, If I pinap half my CDay captures i should have enough to evolve 6 and boost some levels. Hopefully we get weather boost
|c:|1528926028|+Mega Eevee X|I'm pinapping all my cday catches
|c:|1528926278| Maxalexanderpi∞|as you should
|c:|1528926313| Shotgun2010|I wouldn’t pinap one I knew was 91+ or shiny or lv35 it’s too risky
|c:|1528926339| Shotgun2010|that leaves about 80-90% to be pinapped
|c:|1528926479|+Mega Eevee X|Oh
|c:|1528926493|+Mega Eevee X|I'm pinapping all my non shiny comm day catches*
|c:|1528926522| Shotgun2010|I will be sure to snag as many as possible
|c:|1528926545| Shotgun2010|the most important community day since dratini
|c:|1528926565|@anubis|I'm gonna go out and hope I get in on some raids.
|c:|1528926568|+Mega Eevee X|I'd argue the most important Community day ever
|c:|1528926569|@anubis|Before the sun goes down.
|c:|1528926578|@anubis|Let me go find someone to babysit the room.
|c:|1528926590|+Mega Eevee X|Alright, gl with raiding Anubis
|c:|1528926598| Shotgun2010|they’ll make a decent rayquaza counter won’t they
|c:|1528926619|+Mega Eevee X|TTar will be the best rock attacker in the game
|c:|1528926645|+Mega Eevee X|Until either Rhyperior or Terrakion depending on movesets
|c:|1528926664| DeltaRenegade|So Smack Down would be its best move?
|c:|1528926674| Maxalexanderpi∞|>babysit
|c:|1528926676| Maxalexanderpi∞|us?
|c:|1528926678| Maxalexanderpi∞|;-;
|c:|1528926687| Maxalexanderpi∞|w-w-we're responsible
|c:|1528926690| jh3828 (seal) ✓|lmfao
|c:|1528926696|+Mega Eevee X|It's best rock move delta
|c:|1528926718|+Mega Eevee X|It will be the best attacker of two types after this community day
|c:|1528926725| DeltaRenegade|Two types?
|c:|1528926729|@kay|hello people of Go
|c:|1528926729| Shotgun2010|yeah SD ttar will be the best rayquaza counter
|c:|1528926731| DeltaRenegade|Rock and Dark?
|c:|1528926735|+Mega Eevee X|Yeah
|c:|1528926737| jh3828 (seal) ✓|hello
|c:|1528926745| DeltaRenegade|Also oh shit congrats on Voice over here Mes
|c:|1528926747| DeltaRenegade|Mex*
|c:|1528926770|+Mega Eevee X|It's the top dark type attacker with Bite/Crunch and will be the best rock type attacker with Smack Down and I think stone edge?
|c:|1528926772|+Mega Eevee X|And Ty
|c:|1528926779| Shotgun2010|also apparently frost breath ice beam mew is second best counter to ray?
|c:|1528926786| Shotgun2010|is that a mistake or
|c:|1528926792| DeltaRenegade|Oh
|c:|1528926796|+Mega Eevee X|It's the second best ice attacker
|c:|1528926797| DeltaRenegade|Smack Down is a fast move?
|c:|1528926800|+Mega Eevee X|Yeah
|c:|1528926806| DeltaRenegade|Oh shit
|c:|1528926810| Shotgun2010|is arti the best?
|c:|1528926817|+Mega Eevee X|Mew is the current second best ice attacker after articuno
|c:|1528926818| DeltaRenegade|Im used to the CD moves being charged
|c:|1528926825| Shotgun2010|makes sense
|c:|1528926834|+Mega Eevee X|This is the first quick CD move
|c:|1528926838| DeltaRenegade|Yeah
|c:|1528926840| DeltaRenegade|Noted
|c:|1528926982|+Mega Eevee X|This will be the best community day though
|c:|1528926993|+Mega Eevee X|Second being dratini and third being bulbasaur
|c:|1528927025| JB17|Worst was charmander
|c:|1528927045| Maxalexanderpi∞|nah
|c:|1528927046|+Mega Eevee X|Worst was Pikachu
|c:|1528927049| Maxalexanderpi∞|^
|c:|1528927049|+Mega Eevee X|By far
|c:|1528927052| Maxalexanderpi∞|or bulba
|c:|1528927060|+Mega Eevee X|Bulba was amazing
|c:|1528927065| JB17|For me was Charmander... 0 shinies
|c:|1528927083|+Mega Eevee X|Frenzy Plant Venusaur is one of the best grass attackers in existence
|c:|1528927097| JB17|Very useful against kyogre
|c:|1528927110|+Mega Eevee X|Yeah
|c:|1528927139|+Mega Eevee X|It's the second best attacker against non blizzard Kyogres and I think the 6th best against blizzard
|c:|1528927198| Shotgun2010|i use my 93 frenzy shiny a lot
|c:|1528927218| Sho
